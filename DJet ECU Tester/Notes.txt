1. Ideal trigger points are closed for 135 degrees of *distributor* rotation. Worn points can be as high as 170 degrees. Therefore we can simulate worn points by keeping the pulses low for longer. Make this configurable.

2. A complete firing sequence is 720 degrees of crankshaft rotation. Therefore for 1000 RPM a complete firing sequence happens at 500 RPM = 8.333 Hz.

3. Input parameters:

 - Engine speed in RPM
 - Trigger points close time in degrees (default is 135)
 - throttle position in %
 - coolant temp in F
 - air temp in F
 - vacuum in in Hg (initally not used)

4. Control testing via COM port, allow commands to be sent that set parameters. Implement a command line program to send the commands. E.g:

  djetecu --engspeed 1000 --throttle 56 --coolanttemp 180 --airtemp 82 --triggerpointsclosedangle 140

can be expanded later on to dynamically change values, e.g.:

  djetecu --startengspeed 1000 --stopengspeed 2000 --incengspeed 100
